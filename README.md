Minimal experiments exploring task-relative emergence and state abstractions in dynamic graph systems.
# Task-Relative Emergence (Minimal Experiments)

This repository contains a small, controlled experiment exploring how
different state summaries of the same system become useful or useless
depending on the task.

## Core Question
Are emergent variables intrinsic to a system, or relative to the task
used to evaluate the system?

## Experiment Summary
- System: Dynamic graph with a structural regime change
- Representations: average degree, clustering coefficient, algebraic connectivity (λ₂)
- Tasks:
  1. Global regime detection
  2. Local structural change detection

The same representations behave differently under different tasks.

## Files
- `experiment.ipynb` — main Colab notebook
- `figures/` — output plots

## Status
Exploratory, minimal, and intentionally simple.
This is not a finished research project.
